          ETHIOPIA DIASPORA TRUST FUND (EDTF) and Ethiopia COVID-19 Response
          Team (ECRT)
        </h5>
        <h6>Partnership Note</h6>
        <h6>Purpose</h6>
        <p>
          The Joint Ethiopia Diaspora Trust Fund (EDTF) and Ethiopia COVID-19
          Response Team (ECRT) fund, EDTF x ECRT, is established by the EDTF
          Advisory Council in partnership with the volunteer Ethiopian COVID-19
          Response Team, in recognition of the new challenge and existential
          threat that coronavirus (i.e. SARS-COV-2) represents to the wellbeing
          and livelihood of the Ethiopian people and in particular the most
          disadvantaged segments of the population.
        </p>
        <p>
          This initiative will support the ECRT mission to help meaningfully
          flatten the curve, help make more readily available and support
          adoption technological solutions, and creatively address communal
          challenges that make preventive measures especially difficult in
          Ethiopia.
        </p>
        <p>
          EDTF x ECRT conforms with the aligned objective of EDTF COVID -19 to
          support first responders and healthcare professionals and meeting the
          critical needs of disadvantaged
        </p>

        <h6>Operational Modality</h6>
        <p>
          The campaign against COVID-19, particularly in countries like Ethiopia
          that face institutional and financial resource challenges, requires
          effective national coordination of the activities to be undertaken. As
          a result, the EDTF x ECRT fund will be primarily guided by the work
          done by our nonprofit and healthcare partners on the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          In recognition of other organizations that have already initiated
          activities to support the national COVID-19 campaign through medical
          advisory and financial support. Whenever the opportunity exists, EDTF
          COVID-19 will work in partnership with such organizations while
          ensuring the transparent and accountable reporting of the funds
          contributed by its Ethiopian Diaspora and other donors.
        </p>
        <p>
          EDTF COVID-19 will be established as a separate window in the EDTF
          donation portal so as to enable ECRTâ€™s donors to contribute
          specifically to the initiatives under ECRT Strategic pillars. The
          separate window will also facilitate separate and identifiable
          transparent reporting of donations received in the ECRT account and
          the amount used out of it.
        </p>

        <h6>Approval Process</h6>
        <p>
          The EDTF x ECRT fund is not a project-based intervention similar to
          the regular EDTF donations. To appropriately allocate the available
          funds, approval will be sent to the full ECRT Operations Team
          requesting a one-day approval or objection with quorum vote
          (three-fourths present). The approved amount will be used to directly
          pay suppliers or other organizations for the procurement of similar
          items through a competitive solicitation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The approved purchases will be sent to the EDTF Secretariat for
          dispersal; in quantities of 10K or more.
        </p>
        <h6>Payments</h6>
        <p>
          Similar to the EDTF COVID-19 fund, the EDTF x ECRT fund will be
          governed by the EDTF Secretariat and Advisory Council. ECRT agrees to
          contribute 10K towards EDTF operations costs associated with the
          account in appreciation for their governance of the account.
        </p>
        <p>
          ECFT will identify partners on the ground will supply EDTF with the
          information necessary to disperse funds according to EDTF
          requirements. ECRT will also follow EDTF standards for invoice format
          and EDTF will seed the ECRT account with $50,000 USD and ECRT is
          responsible for identifying donors and raising the necessary funds to
          execute on our initiatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          As funds are collected, ECRT will allocate them towards the priorities
