          ETHIOPIA DIASPORA TRUST FUND (EDTF) and Ethiopia COVID-19 Response
          Team (ECRT)
        </h5>

        <h5>Partnership Note</h5>
        <hr />
        <h6>Purpose</h6>
        <p>
          The Joint Ethiopia Diaspora Trust Fund (EDTF) and Ethiopia COVID-19
          Response Team (ECRT) subaccount, Ethiopian COVID-19 Response Team
          Donation, is established by the EDTF Advisory Council in partnership
          with the volunteer Ethiopian COVID-19 Response Team, in recognition of
          the new challenge and existential threat that coronavirus (i.e.
          SARS-COV-2) represents the wellbeing and livelihood of the Ethiopian
          people and in particular the most disadvantaged segments of the
          population.
        </p>
        <p>
          This initiative will support the ECRT mission to minimize morbidity
          and mortality from COVID-19 in Ethiopia, to support adoption of
          technological solutions and make them more readily available, and to
          creatively address communal challenges that make preventive measures
          especially difficult in Ethiopia.
        </p>
        <p>
          ECRT Donation conforms with the aligned objective of EDTF Emergency
          COVID-19 Mitigation (EDTF COVID-19) window to support first responders
          and healthcare professionals and meet the critical needs of the
          disadvantaged.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h6>Operational Modality</h6>
        <p>
          The campaign against COVID-19, particularly in countries like Ethiopia
          that face institutional and financial resource challenges, requires
          effective national coordination of the activities to be undertaken. As
          a result, the ECRT Donation fund will be primarily guided by the
          overall COVID-19 Ethiopian national priorities and the work done by
          our nonprofit and healthcare partners on the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          EDTF COVID-19 recognizes other organizations that have already
          initiated activities to support the national COVID-19 campaign through
          medical advisory and financial support. Whenever the opportunity
          exists, EDTF COVID-19 will work in partnership with such organizations
          while ensuring the transparent and accountable reporting of the funds
          contributed by its Ethiopian Diaspora and other donors.
        </p>
        <p>
          ECRT will be established as a separate window in the EDTF donation
          portal so as to enable ECRT donors to contribute specifically to the
          initiatives under ECRT Strategic pillars. The separate window will
          also facilitate separate and identifiable transparent reporting of
          donations received in the ECRT account and the amount used out of it.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h6>Approval Process</h6>
        <p>
          The ECRT fund is not a project-based intervention similar to the EDTF
          COVID-19 donations. To appropriately allocate the available funds,
          approval will be made by the full ECRT Operations Team within a
          one-day approval process or objection with quorum vote (three-fourths
          present). The approved amount will be used to directly pay suppliers,
          selected through a competitive solicitation process, and/or
          organizations that will implement activities under ECRT Strategic
          Pillars.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h6>Payments</h6>
        <p>
          Similar to the EDTF COVID-19 fund, the ECRT fund will be governed by
          the EDTF Advisory Council. ECRT agrees to contribute initially 10K to
          cover the estimated operational costs of EDTF in hosting ECRT and
          administering and disbursing ECRT funds. The actual costs will be
          assessed periodically every six-months on the basis of experience
          gained.
        </p>
        <p>
          ECRT will be responsible for identifying donors and raising the
          necessary funds to execute on its initiatives. ECRT will follow EDTF
          standard form for invoicing and reporting.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          As funds are collected, ECRT will allocate them towards the priorities
